\par The goal of this assignment is to design the group's own circuit, specifically one that converts Alternate Current into Direct Current. This circuit is composed of a full wave rectifier utilizing 4 diodes, an envelope detector and a voltage regulator designed to stabilize the voltage in 12V, which is a resistor and a series of diodes, as can be seen in the figure below.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation using NGSpice, with its results being compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis} in the Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, while also outlining in this section the conclusions of this study.
