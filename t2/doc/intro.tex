\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\paragraph{}
\par The aim of this assignment is to properly analyze and study a RC circuit composed of a voltage source, a dependent voltage source, a dependent current source, a capacitor and seven resistors.
The main focus is to create a comparison between the theoretical analysis of the circuit and a simulation using the software NGspice.
\par 
\par The circuit is represented with resort to \textit{LibreOffice Draw} and can be viewed in figure \ref{circuit}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
