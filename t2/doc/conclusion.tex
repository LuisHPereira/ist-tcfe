\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\paragraph{}
\par It is possible to conclude, similar to the first assignment, that the values of the current in the branches, the voltage in the nodes and the equivalent resistant achieved using theory with the aid of Octave resulted in the same values as the obtained through the NGspice simulation. The difference between them is practically null. Just like in the first lab, this is due to the fact that the circuit is linear, given that he only new element, the capacitor, is also linear. 
\par The assignment was successfully completed.
