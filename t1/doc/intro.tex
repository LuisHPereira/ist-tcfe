\par The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit in which we have the following components: two current sources ($I_b$ and $I_d$), one of them voltage dependent ($I_b$), two voltage sources ($V_a$ and $V_c$), one of them current dependent ($V_c$) and seven resistors. 
\par The circuit is represented with resort to \textit{LibreOffice Draw} and can be viewed in figure \ref{circuit}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
